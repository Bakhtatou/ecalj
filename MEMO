  number of ngc (plane wave for Coulomb matrix) is given as the
  console out put of qg4gw. b
  However used ngc for iq>nqibz is ngc for q=0 (rdata4gw_v2).
  So ngc read from readqg('QGpsi') and getppx can be diffent.
  We need to clean it up.

  To develop sigma-interpolation for QSGW in MTO+APW, PWMODE=1 should be used;
  then number of APW is not q-dependent.

  As we use small MT, we may be able to fix phi and phidot. Then we
  can reduce compuational time so much. However, problem in GW is we
  may need to use large mixed basid for PW part by enlarged QpGcut_cou
  (also for psi). It may be better to re-consider smoothe mixed basis
  for the expantion of products of "phi and phi" for Coulomb
  interaction.
