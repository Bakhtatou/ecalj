=== GGA/LDA calculations ====================
Si, InAs, ZnS:

>mkdir Si_test
>cd Si_test
>cp ../ctrls.si .
>ctrlgen2.py    # you can skip this. to check options.
>ctrlgen2.py si --nk=4
>cp ctrlgen2.ctrl.si ctrl.si  #Here we can edit ctrl.si if you like.
>lmfa si  # atom calculations (preparation"
>lmf si   # GGA/LDA calculation


### BAND plot ###
>cp ../syml.si .
>job_band_nspin1 si
(you can see band plot given by gnuplot).
To show it again, 
>gnuplot -p bnds.gnu.si

NOTE that symmetry lines along which we plot energy bands 
are given in syml.si.


### DOS plot ###
>job_tdos si

For DOS and PDOS plot, it might be better to use larger
NKABC (or nk) to get converged results. 


### PDOS plot ###
>job_pdos si

For your purpose, you may have to edit *.gnu for gnuplot.
job_pdos plot is time-consuming.

------------------------
wGaN:
After you get ctrlgen2.ctrl.wgan. Copy it to ctrl.wgan, and edit it.
to be NKABC 4 4 2. This is suitable for the structure because
c-axis is almost twice larger than a,b-axis.
------------------------
Fe:
>ctrlgen2.py fe --nspin=2 --nk=8
>cp ctrlgen2.ctrl.fe ctrl.fe
Then edit MMOM in ctrl.fe as
  MMOM=0 0 2 0 #s,p,d,f initial condition
>lmfa fe
>lmf fe
save.fe shows magnetic moment.
I found some spike-like noise in DOS plot are removed by large NKABC
(or nk).
Comands job_tdos fe, job_pdos fe works as you expect.
Use job_band_nspin2 fe, because --nspin=2
Two PDOS plots for each sites.
------------------------
NiO:
>ctrlgen2.py nio --nspin=2 --nk=3
>cp ctrlgen2.ctrl.nio ctrl.nio
(nk=2 is not so bad, but a little small; this is for quick test)
Edit ctrl.nio as
      MMOM=0 0 1 0 for Niup
      MOMO=0 0 -1 0 for Nidn
When you enlarge nk, you can start from rst.nio
which is generated by nk=2 
(just keep rst.nio and restart lmf. 
Then remove mixing file mix.nio file).
mmom (next line to site) shows magnetic moment within MTs.

Comands job_tdos nio, job_pdos nio work as you expect.
Use job_band_nspin2 nio, because --nspin=2
Four PDOS plots for each sites.
If you like to resolve t2g and eg,
edit pdos*.gnu.
---------------------------------------

This is shown at the end of job_pdos.
===== PDOS file structure (dos.isp*) =========================
(add +1 since, 1st columun is energy in these pdos files.)
  For s,p,d,f the indices 1-16 correspond to:
      index   l    m     polynomial
         1    0    0        1
    -----------------------------
         2    1   -1        y
         3    1    0        z
         4    1    1        x
    -----------------------------
         5    2   -2        xy
         6    2   -1        yz
         7    2    0        3z^2-1
         8    2    1        xz
         9    2    2        x^2-y^2
    -----------------------------
         10   3   -3        y(3x^2-y^2)
         11   3   -2        xyz
         12   3   -1        y(5z^2-1)
         13   3    0        z(5z^2-3)
         14   3    1        x(5z^2-1)
         15   3    2        z(x^2-y^2)
         16   3    3        x(x^2-3y^2)
   ------------------------
   higher is lm ordered. See Ylm definition in lmto/fpgw doc.

== QSGW calculations ===
You need to have GWinput whose template is given by mkGWIN_lmf2.
After converged, you have not only sigm.nio (e.g, nio case), but also
sigm_fbz.nio. (If not do "lmf nio" again with sigm.nio).

After qsgw is converged, you can use job_band, job_tdos, job_pdos,
as in the same manner of GGA/LDA calculations.


------------
NOTE:
to restart QSGW, you have to keep
rst.* ESEAVR, QGpsi, ctrl.* sigm.*
If you lost QGpsi, you have to do
echo 0|lmfgw
echo 1|qg4gw
to get QGpsi.
