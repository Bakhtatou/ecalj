Run

Then you will have /convert directory which contains fortran files
with indentation. In addition continue lines are added (see top of
redo file).

Problems.
1. In cases it fails. In such a case, error is shown.
   * ! comment may cause problems after do/if  statements or so.
   * (10,20 30) goto integer, should be rewritten by select case.
2. Obtained fortran files do not have perfect indentation for
   contanious lines.
