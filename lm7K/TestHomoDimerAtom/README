=== How to perform test calculations here for H2 diatomic molecules. ===

> job_run.bg (for background job),
    or job_run.qsub (for qsub system) 
This perform all steps below. 
This test (for H2) requires a few minutes or so with a corei5
notebook.

For your convenience, we have pss in this directory; this shows job
status. (and you can kill a submitted job of dimer calculation by "pss -KILL jobid").

---
The followings describes what job_run.bg does.
===================================================
0. Edit 
   jobtemplate.bash (for qsub)  or jobtemplate.bg.bash (for background job) for your system.
1. Setup1. 
  We assume lmf and lmfa in your ~/bin
  >cp job_molecule_dis.py jobmoldimer1 jobqsubdimer.py * ~/bin
  >cp savedata pldimer1 plmol.py ~/bin/   

  >cp pss ~/bin  (pss is just a utility)

2. Setup2.
  Make working directory <work dir>.
  >cp jobdimerlist.test jobtemplate.bash extra.bash homedimerdistance.bash <work dir>
  <work dir> is TEST.bg in the case the job_run.bg.
  I recommend to look into main code jobtemplate.bash, which uses other *.bash files.

3. Run
   > jobbgdimer.py jobdimerlist.test jobtemplate.bash 
   ,where jobqsubdimer.py calls jobmoldimer1
   (use jobqsubdimer.py in the cassub).

You can use jobdimerlist.10 instead of jobdimerlist.test. (or jobdimerlist.15). But roughly speaking,
jobdimerlist.10 (for all dimers) requires 24 hours with 96 core machine.
jobdiemrlist.15 requires one week; it looks too long (we have room to make it efficient ...).
=======================================================

=== How it work ===.
Please look into job_run.bg (or also job_run.qsub).
It is the main script for dimer calculation systems.

After it is finished, you can find
  jobmoldimer1_-0.20,_fsmom=0@_rstar=0.8@__H_H2dis_alatpath5
in Test.bg/. (mkdir Test.bg is in job_run.bg and "cd ${QSUB_WORKDIR}" in jobtemplete.bash)
This is the main script to run a job for 
  magnetic mom=0; distance=-0.2+gaussian value; MT size=0.8*gaussian
value; supercell is 5 angstrome cell .
This corresponds the setting in jobdimertest.list
  distance=0.1;0.1@  fsmom=2@ rstar=0.9@ $O $O2dis $alatpath5
. If you change $alatpath5 to $alatpath10, it mean 15 angstrome cell.
(not a cubic cell, but a deformed cell to break symmetry).

INIT.xxx/ is to generate initial contision.
DimerSYMI.xxx/ is for main calculations...
work.xxx/ is to workarea to generate ctrl files.

Main routinine is jobmoldimer1 (called from
jobqsubdimer.py/jobbgdimer.py), which you copied to your bin.
this generate ctrl files and invoke lmfa, and lmf, and make required
directories.

job_molecule_dis.py called from jobdimer1 is
the main part to generate ctrl file for molecules.

---
PWE control:
In INIT.xxx/, we perform calculations to set up initial condition 
(levels are smeared with Gaussian with bzw=0.001. Thus Bandweight
files shows integration weights can be not 1.00(occupied) nor 0.00(unoccupied).
This bz
Then I do calculations with bzw=0 in DimerSYMI directory with bzw=0
(this is in job_molecule_dis.py).


=== Plot ===
To gather data and plot them, perform 'savedata' command (at /TEST.bg or /TEST.qsub  )

>savedata <2Sz> <Z>
For example
>savedata 0 1
for H_2.
This gives a picture of gnuplot.
Data for plot is in datg.savedata.0.1.
(In cases savedatax works OK; this takes even unconverged cases).
======================================


=== ATOM in supercell ===
Look into Atom/README.
Essentially similar with dimr calculations, but with an atom in the cell.
======================================


DATAdimerJuly1012.tar.gz
Sample of save.dimer when you perform  DATAdimerJuly2012/job.
After you expand it, try 'savedata 6 26' and 'savedata 8 26'.
(calculation is on the way half).
