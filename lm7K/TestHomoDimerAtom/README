=== Dimer and atom calculations in supercell. ===

> make_jobque.bg
> make_jobque.pjsub  for pj subsystem
Please look into make_jobque.* files.
These generate TEST.bg/ or TEST.pjsub/, where we have jobscript
 jobque.bg or jobque.pjsub.

You can run all calculations with 
>bash jobque.bg
or so.

For your convenience, we have pss in this directory; pss shows job
status. pss 1 shows working directory.
(you can kill a submitted job of dimer calculation by "pss -KILL jobid").

---
The followings describes what make_jobque.bg does.
===================================================
1. Setup1. 
  We assume lmf and lmfa in your ~/bin
  >cp jobquescript.py jobmoldimer1.py * ~/bin 
  >cp savedata pldimer1 plmol.py ~/bin/   !these are utilities.

  >cp pss ~/bin  (pss is  a utility)

  jobquescript.py: jobque and job file generator.
  jobmoldimer1.py: ctrl file generator for dimers.

2. Setup2.
  Make working directory <work dir>. 
  >cp jobdimerlist.15 extra.bash homedimerdistance.bash <work dir>
  <work dir> is TEST.bg in the case the job_run.bg.

3. Run 
   jobquescript.py internally calls jobmoldimer1.

The main purpose of make_jobque.bg is to generate required ctrl files,
directories, job files to perform TEST.bg/jobque.
Look into jobque.

You can use jobdimerlist.10 instead of jobdimerlist.test. (or jobdimerlist.15).
jobdimerlist.10 (for all dimers) requires 24 hours with 96 core machine.
jobdiemrlist.15 requires one week; it looks too long (we have room to
make it efficient ...).
=======================================================

=== How it work ===.
Please look into job_run.bg (or also job_run.qsub).
It is the main script for dimer calculation systems.

After it is finished, you can find
  jobmoldimer1_-0.20,_fsmom=0@_rstar=0.8@__H_H2dis_alatpath5
in Test.bg/. 
This is the main script to run a job for 
  magnetic mom=0; distance=-0.2+gaussian value; MT size=0.8*gaussian
value; supercell is 5 angstrome cell .
This corresponds the setting in jobdimerlist.15
  distance=0.1;0.1@  fsmom=2@ rstar=0.9@ $O $O2dis $alatpath5
. If you change $alatpath5 to $alatpath10, it mean 15 angstrome cell.
(not a cubic cell, but a deformed cell to break symmetry).

---
PWE control:
Initial condition is calculated with bzw=0.001. Then we use bzw=1d-6
for main part of calculations. This gives integration zero or unity(occupied).


=== Plot ===
To gather data and plot them, perform 'savedata' command (at /TEST.bg or /TEST.qsub  )

>savedata <2Sz> <Z>
For example
>savedata 0 1
for H_2.
This gives a picture of gnuplot.
Data for plot is in datg.savedata.0.1.
(In cases savedatax works OK; this takes even unconverged cases).
======================================


=== ATOM in supercell ===
Look into Atom/README.
Essentially similar with dimr calculations, but with an atom in the cell.
