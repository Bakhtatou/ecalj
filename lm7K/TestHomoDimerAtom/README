=== Calculations of diatomic molecules. ===
job_run.qsub (for qsub system) 
 or
job_run.bg (for background job),
perform all steps below. It is better 
===
0. Edit 
   jobtemplate.bash (for qsub)  or jobtemplate.bg.bash (for background
   job) for your system.

1. Setup1. 
  We assume lmf and lmfa in your ~/bin
  >cp job_molecule_dis.py jobmoldimer1 jobqsubdimer.py * ~/bin
  >cp savedata pldimer1 plmol.py ~/bin/   

2. Setup2.
  Make working directory <work dir>.
  >cp jobdimerlist.test jobtemplate.bash extra.bash homedimerdistance.bash <work dir>
  I recommend to look into jobtemplate.bash, which used other *.bash files.

3. Run
   > jobqsubdimer.py jobdimerlist.test jobtemplate.bash 
   ,where jobqsubdimer.py calls jobmoldimer1

You can use atomlist.10 or so. But it takes hours, roughly speaking,
atomlist.10 asks a day or so with 96 cores. atomlist.15 asked one
week; it looks too long (probably something inefficient ...).
======================================


=== Plot ===
To gather data and plot them, peform savedata command at TEST.qsub or TEST.bg

>savedata <2Sz> <Z>
For example
>savedata 0 1
for H_2.
