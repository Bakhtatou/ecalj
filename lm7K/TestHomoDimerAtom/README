=== How to perform test calculations here for H2 diatomic molecules. ===

> job_run.bg (for background job),
    or job_run.qsub (for qsub system) 
This perform all steps below. 
This test (for H2) requires a few minutes or so with a corei5
notebook.

For your convenience, we have pss in this directory; this shows job
status. (and you can kill a submitted job of dimer calculation by "pss -KILL jobid").

---
The followings describes what job_run.bg does.
===================================================
0. Edit 
   jobtemplate.bash (for qsub)  or jobtemplate.bg.bash (for background job) for your system.
1. Setup1. 
  We assume lmf and lmfa in your ~/bin
  >cp job_molecule_dis.py jobmoldimer1 jobqsubdimer.py * ~/bin
  >cp savedata pldimer1 plmol.py ~/bin/   

  >cp pss ~/bin  (pss is just a utility)

2. Setup2.
  Make working directory <work dir>.
  >cp jobdimerlist.test jobtemplate.bash extra.bash homedimerdistance.bash <work dir>
  <work dir> is TEST.bg in the case the job_run.bg.
  I recommend to look into main code jobtemplate.bash, which uses other *.bash files.

3. Run
   > jobbgdimer.py jobdimerlist.test jobtemplate.bash 
   ,where jobqsubdimer.py calls jobmoldimer1
   (use jobqsubdimer.py in the case of qsub).

You can use atomlist.10 or so. But it takes hours, roughly speaking,
atomlist.10 (for all dimers) asks a day or so with 96 cores. 
atomlist.15 requires one week; it looks too long (we have room to make it efficient ...).
=======================================================

=== How it work ===.
In Test.bg <work dir>, you see
jobmoldimer1_-0.20,_fsmom=0@_rstar=0.8@__H_H2dis_alatpath5
This is the main script to run a job for 
magnetic mom=0; distance=-0.2+gaussian value; MT size=0.8*gaussian
value; supercell is 5 angstrome cell.

Main routinine is jobmoldimer1, which you copied to your bin.
this generate ctrl files and invoke lmfa, and lmf, and make required
directories.
INIT.xxx/ is to generate initial contision.
DimerSYMI.xxx/ is for main calculations...


=== Plot ===
To gather data and plot them, peform savedata command at /TEST.bg or /TEST.qsub  

>savedata <2Sz> <Z>
For example
>savedata 0 1
for H_2.
This gives a picture of gnuplot.
Data for plot is in datg.savedata.0.1.

=== ATOM in supercell ===
Look into Atom/README.
