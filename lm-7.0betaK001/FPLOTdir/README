This is a package by M. van Schilfgaarde, A.T.Paxton


This package includes a general-purpose plotting program with functionality
roughly similar to gnuplot, and programs 'plbnds' and 'pldos' designed
to read energy bands and density-of-states written by the LMTO package
to create postscript figures.

There is at present minimal documentation for these programs --- sorry.

There are shell scripts,
  examples/test.fplot
  examples/test.plbnds
  examples/test.pldos

which illustrate some features of these programs.
Also you can invoke --help to any of these programs, to get a brief synopsis
of the available options.

Unlike gnuplot, program fplot does not work in an interactive mode.
Instead you send arguments from the command-line, or put the different
plotting instructions into a file.  An example of the latter is
shown in the scripts examples/test.pldos and examples/test.plbnds.

Mainly fplot is intended for x-y data, and it typically reads data in
through ascii files.  The ascii files can contain data in many kinds
of formats, but the simplest consists of columns of numbers or
or algebraic expressions.  For example suppose file 'dat' contains

  1 1*1
  2 2*2
  3 3*3
  4 4*4

Invoking 'fplot dat' would create a postscript file with a line connecting
4 points following the shape of a parabola.  If instead 'dat' contained

  % repeat i=1:20
    {i} {i*i}
  % end

Then invoking 'fplot dat' would create a postscript file with a line
connecting 20 points in the shape of a parabola.  Each data file is
run through a preprocessor which interprets many lines beginning with
'%' as commands, rather than as data.  See etc/file-preprocessor.txt
for documentation describing the operation of the preprocessor.
The preprocessor itself is written in slatsm/rdfiln.f.

------------------- INSTALLATION ----------------

To install, you must have first installed the slatsm library, which is a
library of generic math functions, and whose tar file is SLATSM.vsn-no.tar.gz
Installation of that package creates an archive 'slatsm.a'

With luck, this package will install automatically, using 'configure'
If you have trouble, look at the README in the slatsm library for
guidance on how to make corrections specific to your platform

Standard way to install:

1.  Assign environment variable LIBSLA path of slatsm.a, e.g.
    LIBSLA = /usr/people/markv/slatsm/slatsm.a

2.  Invoke 'configure'

3.  Invoke 'make -f Makefile progs'

Now programs 'fplot', 'pldos' and 'plbnds' should be created.  To check them
one-by-one (and also see examples of how the programs work) invoke scripts

4.  examples/test.fplot
    examples/test.pldos
    examples/test.plbnds

Alternatively, you can invoke

4.  make -f Makefile check

which just runs the three shell scripts in 'quiet' mode --- useful
for quickly checking correct functioning of programs.

Finally, you can install these programs into a bindir (defaults to ../bin)
with

5.  make -f Makefile install
